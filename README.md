# Require Pull Request to be approved

If you can't / don't want to use branch protection rules, then you can use this action instead.

This action will check the following:
- That all requested and actual (non-requested reviewers that left changes requests) reviewers have approved the Pull Request.
- That at least one member of any team that has been requested for a review, approved the Pull Request.
